//Call stack is a datastructer that records where in the program we are.
//Push Pop to and from it
//What happens when things are slow?
//Blocking happens, when you make calls that are sycronhes it will block the stack untill they are finished
//thus makes the UI unavailable to do anything or runs any other code
//to solve this we use asynchronous callbacks
//how does a settimeout work, how does it push thigs onto the stack after sometime?
//Concurrency & the Event Loop
